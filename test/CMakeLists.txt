ABOUT THE SUPERTOOL!
All of your MX record, DNS, blacklist and SMTP diagnostics in one integrated tool.  Input a domain name or IP Address or Host Name. Links in the results will guide you to other relevant tools and information.  And you'll have a chronological history of your results. 

If you already know exactly what you want, you can force a particular test or lookup.  Try some of these examples:

(e.g. "blacklist: 127.0.0.2" will do a blacklist lookup)

spf:	 	Check SPF records on a domain
txt:	 	Check TXT records on a domain
ptr:	 	DNS PTR record for host name
cname:	 	DNS canonical host name to IP address
